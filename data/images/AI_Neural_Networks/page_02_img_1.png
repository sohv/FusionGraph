# RNN Architecture Diagram
# This would be an actual PNG/JPEG image showing:
# - Unfolded RNN structure across time steps
# - Hidden state connections between time steps
# - Input and output at each time step
# - LSTM cell internal structure
# File: rnn_architecture_diagram.png
# Size: 1000x500 pixels
# Caption: "Recurrent Neural Network architecture showing temporal dependencies and hidden state propagation"
