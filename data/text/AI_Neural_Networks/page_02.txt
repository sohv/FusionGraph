Chapter 2: Types of Neural Networks

Different architectures of neural networks have been developed to solve specific types of problems. Understanding these architectures is crucial for selecting the appropriate model for a given task.

Feedforward Networks:
The simplest type of neural network where information flows in one direction from input to output. These networks consist of:
- Input layer: Receives the initial data
- Hidden layers: Perform computations and feature extraction
- Output layer: Produces the final result

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Specifically designed for processing grid-like data such as images. CNNs use:
- Convolutional layers: Apply filters to detect local features
- Pooling layers: Reduce spatial dimensions while preserving important information
- Fully connected layers: Combine features for final classification

Applications of CNNs include:
- Computer vision tasks (object detection, image classification)
- Medical image analysis (X-ray interpretation, MRI scanning)
- Autonomous driving (road sign recognition, pedestrian detection)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
Designed to process sequential data by maintaining memory of previous inputs. RNNs are particularly useful for:
- Natural language processing (translation, text generation)
- Time series prediction (stock prices, weather forecasting)
- Speech recognition and synthesis

The architecture diagram shows how RNNs maintain hidden states that carry information across time steps, enabling them to learn temporal dependencies in data.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a special type of RNN that can learn long-term dependencies more effectively than traditional RNNs.
