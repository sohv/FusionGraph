Chapter 3: Training Neural Networks

Training a neural network involves adjusting its parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs. This process requires careful consideration of several factors.

The Training Process:
1. Forward Propagation: Input data flows through the network to produce predictions
2. Loss Calculation: Compare predictions with ground truth using a loss function
3. Backpropagation: Calculate gradients of the loss with respect to network parameters
4. Parameter Update: Adjust weights and biases using optimization algorithms

Loss Functions:
Different types of problems require different loss functions:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Used for regression problems
- Cross-entropy: Used for classification tasks
- Huber loss: Robust loss function for regression with outliers

Optimization Algorithms:
- Gradient Descent: Basic optimization algorithm that updates parameters in the direction of steepest descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): Uses random samples to estimate gradients
- Adam: Adaptive learning rate algorithm that combines momentum with adaptive learning rates
- RMSprop: Addresses the diminishing learning rate problem in AdaGrad

Regularization Techniques:
To prevent overfitting and improve generalization:
- Dropout: Randomly deactivate neurons during training
- L1/L2 Regularization: Add penalty terms to the loss function
- Batch Normalization: Normalize inputs to each layer
- Early Stopping: Stop training when validation performance stops improving

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Key hyperparameters to optimize include:
- Learning rate: Controls the step size of parameter updates
- Batch size: Number of samples processed before updating parameters
- Number of epochs: Complete passes through the training data
- Network architecture: Number of layers and neurons per layer

The training curves diagram illustrates how loss decreases and accuracy increases over training epochs for both training and validation sets.
