# FusionGraph Research-Grade Evaluation Framework

## Overview

This evaluation framework provides comprehensive, quantitative assessment of the FusionGraph multimodal RAG system using three rigorous research-grade tests. These metrics enable benchmarking, research publication, and systematic optimization.

## Three Core Evaluation Tests

### 1. Retrieval Quality Assessment
**Purpose**: Measure how well the system retrieves relevant documents for given queries.

**Metrics Implemented**:
- **NDCG@K** (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain): Measures ranking quality with position-aware scoring
- **MRR** (Mean Reciprocal Rank): Average reciprocal rank of first relevant result
- **Precision@K**: Fraction of top-K results that are relevant
- **Recall@K**: Fraction of all relevant documents found in top-K

**Research Applications**:
- Compare retrieval performance against baselines (BM25, TF-IDF, other embedding models)
- Evaluate impact of different chunking strategies and embedding models
- Measure Faiss vs. traditional retrieval speed/accuracy tradeoffs

**Ground Truth Requirements**:
- Human-annotated relevance judgments (0-3 scale)
- Query-document pairs with expert annotations
- Domain-specific evaluation datasets

### 2. Factual Consistency & Grounding
**Purpose**: Evaluate whether generated answers are factually grounded in retrieved sources.

**Metrics Implemented**:
- **Claim Verification Score**: NLI-based entailment between claims and sources
- **Support Ratio**: Percentage of claims supported by evidence
- **Hallucination Ratio**: Percentage of claims contradicted by sources
- **Entity Consistency**: Named entity alignment between answer and sources

**Research Applications**:
- Measure hallucination rates in multimodal RAG systems
- Compare factual grounding across different LLM backends
- Evaluate impact of retrieval quality on answer factuality
- Support claims about reduced hallucination in knowledge-grounded systems

**Evaluation Methods**:
- Natural Language Inference (NLI) models for entailment checking
- Named Entity Recognition for entity extraction and comparison
- Automatic claim extraction from generated text
- Reference-based consistency scoring

### 3. Multimodal Integration Quality
**Purpose**: Assess how effectively the system integrates visual and textual information.

**Metrics Implemented**:
- **Cross-Modal Alignment**: Semantic coherence between text and image sources
- **OCR Accuracy**: Quality of text extraction from images
- **Visual QA Correctness**: Accuracy on visual question answering tasks
- **Source Relevance**: Relevance of both modalities to the query

**Research Applications**:
- Validate multimodal fusion approaches
- Compare text-only vs. multimodal RAG performance
- Evaluate OCR quality impact on retrieval accuracy
- Measure cross-modal semantic alignment

**Evaluation Approaches**:
- Semantic similarity between text and image captions/OCR
- Character-level OCR accuracy against ground truth
- Visual QA benchmarks with known correct answers
- Cross-modal retrieval precision

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

```python
# Main evaluation suite
FusionGraphEvaluationSuite()
├── RetrievalQualityEvaluator()    # Test 1: IR metrics
├── FactualConsistencyEvaluator()  # Test 2: Grounding metrics  
└── MultimodalGroundingEvaluator() # Test 3: Multimodal metrics
```

### Data Structures

```python
@dataclass
class EvaluationResult:
    test_name: str
    metric_scores: Dict[str, float]
    detailed_results: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    execution_time: float
    timestamp: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Evaluation
```python
from evaluation.evaluation_framework import FusionGraphEvaluationSuite

# Initialize evaluation suite
eval_suite = FusionGraphEvaluationSuite()

# Run comprehensive evaluation
test_queries = [
    "How does AI help in medical diagnosis?",
    "What are knowledge graphs used for?",
    "How do computer vision models work?"
]

results = eval_suite.run_comprehensive_evaluation(
    visual_rag_pipeline, 
    test_queries
)
```

### Individual Test Evaluation
```python
# Test 1: Retrieval Quality
retrieval_eval = RetrievalQualityEvaluator()
metrics = retrieval_eval.evaluate_retrieval_quality(
    retrieval_results, 
    query_id="q1", 
    k_values=[1, 3, 5]
)

# Test 2: Factual Consistency  
factual_eval = FactualConsistencyEvaluator()
consistency_metrics = factual_eval.evaluate_factual_consistency(
    generated_answer, 
    source_texts
)

# Test 3: Multimodal Grounding
multimodal_eval = MultimodalGroundingEvaluator()
grounding_result = multimodal_eval.evaluate_multimodal_grounding(
    query, 
    text_sources, 
    image_sources
)
```

### Running Full Evaluation
```bash
# Command line evaluation
python evaluation/run_evaluation.py

# Jupyter notebook evaluation
jupyter notebook notebooks/evaluation_demo.ipynb
```
